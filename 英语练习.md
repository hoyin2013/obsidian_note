Ma'am,I'm sorry.
but your credit card has been declined.
What?
Oh,no,that's impossible.
It's a new card.
I just went shopping with it.
Try it again.
Ma'am,I ran it three times.
and then I called the bank.
Now may I try another card?
of course you may.
Will you just give me a moment?
Hello,it's me.
I've been trying to call you.
but you turned your cell off.
Because I'm in a lovely restaurant having 
a lovely meal that I now can't pay for.
Well,did you order already?
I ate already.
Look,the credit card company called my mom.
I mean,they said that there was unusual activity on my card.
I bought shoes.
Well,I didn't know that.
You know,and then my mom started asking all 
these questions so I just blurted out that the card was
stolen and she canceled it.
Why would they call your parents?
It's your acount.
They co-signed for it.
Look,if you just explain to the waiter...
What?
That the credit card was cancelled
by my lover's mommy.
Well,what other options do you have?
Unless you return the shoes and get the money back.
Return the shoes?
I can't talk to you when you're being hysterical.
So,ma'am
What would you like to do about the bill?

So,Andrew,it's been a long time.
Yes,yes,it has,would you like some water,I have flat or bubbly?
Oh,bubbly please.
So,your mother tell me you have some sexual desire for other boys.
I don't suppose I could get some of that?
Nope,I'm gonna need every drop.
And over the years,we've had so many young people come to our ministry.   ministry 牧师会 
hating themselves for their unnatural desires.
and within a few months they've found an inner peace and transquility.   平静和安宁
that is nothing sort of miraculous. 这简直是奇迹
All it takes is a little faith and a desire to change.
I'm sorry but I really don't want to talk about my sex life.
Well,that's just too bad because this needs to be discussed.
Bree,please,let the boy speak.
Go on.
Well,I appreciate your offer to help.I do.But...
I don't hate myself.
So,I'm good.
Son,I know what it's like to be a teenager.
It's a very confusing time.
I'm not confused.
I know exactly who I am.
Well,if you ever do want to talk.
my door is always open.

Hi,honey,look at my shoes
yeah
aren't they gorgeous?(漂亮)
Honey,I'm tring to watch the game
Sorry
How'd you buy new shoes?
Talk later,you're watching the game
No,I wannna take about it now
You dont have any money,so what's the story?
You've heart it before
Girl meets boy,boy buys girl things,girl leaves happy
What did you do?
You know,I forgot how generous men could be
I also forgot I have options
A whole bunch of them
What the hell are you talking about?
I don't need your credit cards,Carlos,And I don't need your money
But if our marriage is going to work,I need your respect
I'm not ripping up the post-nup
yes,you are,because if you don't,I'm going to put on my new shoes and walk out of the door
You are threading me
no,I'm just pointing something out
I'm a pretty girl,and pretty girls are never lonely

Mrs. Mccluskey
are you all right?
How did you get in here?
Uh,Mr. Mulins had a spare
Why didn't you open the door?
Because I was hoping that you'd go away
Have you been taking your arthritis medication?
I don't need to
Sometimes the pain goes away by itself
Uh-huh
Is that why you didn't open the door
because of your hands?
Mrs. Mccluskey
do you have anyone that could help you out?
A relative?A friend?
I'm fine
Okay
Uh...before you go...
Open these,would you,and put out the pills
Yeah
And don't get your hands all over them
God knows what your kids have picked up
Last thing I need's a case of pink eye
You're a piece of work,you know that?
Well,this is crazy
why'd they give you childproof caps
First thing tomorrow,I'll take you to the pharmacy
and we'll get you new bottles
Don't do me any favors.You don't even like me
I don't want you doing anything
because you feel obligated（责任）
Let me tell you something
half of life is obligations
You don't wanna go to your husband's company Christmas party,but you do
You don't wanna sell candy so your kid's band can buy piccolos,but you do it
You attend your third cousin's wedding
You pick up the dry cleaning
That's life,it's obligations
And you are now my obligation
So tomorrow morning
I'll pick you up and we'll go to the pharmacy
Gee,I'm touched by your outpouring of compassion
We don't have to be friends
But we're two human beings
living on the same piece of earth
We can at least try and help each other out once in a while（偶尔）
And you know what?
I am going to take this
Fine
I'll see you tomorrow morning
Pick me up at nine
And don't be late

```

# DAY377

Mrs. Solis
What a surprise
We haven't seen you in here in quite some time
Yes,yes,I know
My husband and I went through a down-sizing phase
but we've snapped out of it
Life is good
Oh,and this would make it so much better
Excellent
Slip inside,see how that feels
Oh,I'd love to have this in my driveway by Saturday
I'm having a big barbecue
and I want everyone to see it
How exciting,what's the occasion?
I'm throwing my husband a going-away party
Really?Where's he going?
It's a sort of government-sponsored sabbatical
How long is he gonna be gone?
Eight months
Six with good behavior
Isn't the leather interior wonderful?
It is.It is.It's just the smell's a little intense
That's because it was imported from Italy
It's 100% Italian calf
I am so sorry
It just hit me out of nowhere
It's so weird
Smells have been making me nauseous lately
Boobs tender?Achy back?
Yeah
Has it been going around?
Only for centuries
I went through it all when I was carrying my eldest
The truth is
you're never gonna fit a child safety seat in the back
of that tiny Spyder anyway
The four-doors are much roomier
What...
I'm sorry,you...
You think I'm pregnant?
No,I'm not pregnant
Oh
you just have all the synptoms,I just assumed
Well,you assumed wrong
I'm sorry
I'm on the pill,for God's sakes
Yeah,and another thing,I don't want a four-door
I want a sexy little convertible
And I wanna buy one,right now
I'll go start the paperwork
Well,not this one.I vomited in this one
Right.
We'll find you a fresh one


```

# DAY378

Hey,Paul,What's up?
Something's been nagging me,Edie
and I want to talk to you about it
Okay
That night I found you in my house
Why were you really there？
You know why
I came by to drop off your key
Some things were moved around in my living room
What were you looking for?
What are you talking about?
Do I have to call the police?
Do whatever you want
Suit yourself
Okay,okay
Susan made me do it
She has this fixation on
why Mary Alice killed herself
and she keeps blathering on about
blackmail notes and dead babies
Oh,and she got really hot and bothered
when she found the name "Angela"
written on one of your videotapes
Did she find what she was looking for?
No.You came home before she had a chance to watch the video
I see
She sort of thinks you're evil
Thank you,Edie


```

# DAY379

```
So,I've been thinking about the pharmacist.
George.What about him?
I don't think you should go out with him.
Please don't be this way.
he's the only friend I have who's interested in cultural things.
Bree,I'm worried.
because he is obviously still in love with you.
No,he just wants to be friends.
He told me so
Well,what else would a man in love say?
He's desperate to spend time with you.
He does not seem desperate to me.
I saw the way his hands trembled when you touched his shoulder
They did?
When we first started dating the same thing happened to me
I don't remember that.
Listen,continuing to see him.
would just be giving him false hope.
Well,I certainly don't want to hurt him.Again.
No,you don't
I even think it would be a good idea to switch pharmacies.
Really?
Well,ok
You know what I'm gonna miss most about him?
George always has a way of making me feel good about myself
Yeah,he's a terrific guy.

```

# DAY380

Gabrielle！What brings you down here?
Oh,sweet mother of god
what have you done this time?
You're pregnant？
Yes.
And it's impossible,I'm on the pill
which I know you probably think is a sin
but it works
It's a 99.9% effective sin
Well,maybe it's in that
one tenth of percent that god resides
Couldn't wait to throw that in,could you?
Look,god is screwing with me
He doesn't like the way I live my life
so he's punishing me
Well,have you done something that would
warrant(保证) being punished?
The gardener?
I thought that was over
No,it was,and then...
You just had to be there   
But,that's my point is,I'd be an awful mother
I'm selfish and I'm self-centered
And the only person more self-center
than me is Carlos
I mean,he's so self-centered that he doesn't even
know how self-centered I am
We'd be terrible parents
Gabrielle,I'd like to help
but I'm not exactly sure what it is you want
You know,it's just...
I wanna know who to be angry at
Here's a thought
don't be angry
Be thankful.Children are a gift,are they not?
I don't have time for this crap  
I have a party to plan

```

# DAY381

```
Thanks
Edie,hey
Wow,Things are really coming along
Yeah
Slowly and expensively
Well,it'll be worth it
You're doing an amazing job
So look,you're basically a
predator and I need some advice
And I know Tom loves me
but I don't trust this woman
I think there's an agenda there
I don't know,maybe I'm being paranoid
No,no,You did the right thing coming to me
There are two ways to approach this
Well,I'll have to ask
what kind of shape is this woman in?
Fantastic shape,she's gorgeous
Okay,
Now there's really only one way to approach this
You're gonna have to act fast
I'm listening
Well,it's really pretty simple
When I feel threatened by a woman
I pull her in
I make her my best friend
I thought you didn't have any female friends
I don't
And I've never felt threatened
by another woman either
But the point is...
Keep your friends close
Keep your enemies closer


```

# DAY382

This is Miss Foster
Hi
She's an old,old friend of your daddy's
Hey,what you got there?
It's a picture we painted
Oh,let me have a look at that
It's all of us with mommy and daddy
We're really happy
Oh,that is so adorable
When did you do this?
Today.Mom told us to
I just told them to paint something nice
The sentiment's all theirs
But you told us to
Hold on,honey,grown-ups are talking
Well,this is really neat
Hey,how would you boys like to
paint my portrait one day?
Sure,you're pretty
Ok,great
So like your dad said,it's time for bed
I'll take them back upstairs
Come on,guys
Thank you
Here we go
I must say,Lynette
your home is warm and inviting
Your children are absolutely precious
This whole evening was practically a commercial for the perfect family
You think?
You couldn't have planned it any better
And I mean that
Good

```

# DAY383

```
So,that was quite a show you put on tonight
Show?
The boys paintings all these references to(表明) how happy we are
What's wrong with subtly reminding Annabel
that you're happily married?
Because it wasn't subtle
and it's an insult to me
I did not mean it that way 我不是那个意思
Are you so insecure that you have to pull that crap?
Keep your voice down
It doesn't matter if she has feelings for me
as long as I'm not interested  只要我不感兴趣
Have I ever,ever given you any reason to doubt me
Anyone is capable of anything
The first time we ever met,you were cheating
With you!Cheating with you
It's a pattern of behavior
Argh!Give me a break
Well,what am I supposed to do? 我该怎么办？
You fire your old girlfriend
and you don't tell me about it for three months
I could have told you from day one
and you would still be jumping down my throat
No,Annabel is ancient history
She's in the next room
How long do we have to be married,Lynette
how long until you actually trust me?
I trust you
How many times have you said to me that
"if you ever touch another woman
I will take the boys and I will walk out of here
and you will never see us again"?
Well,that's just...
something wives say to their husbands
Not all wives
God,Lynette
you're just so convinced that I'm gonna be unfaithful
It makes me sick,the distruct,the paranoia（偏执狂）...
You know,you know
it seems like you're not gonna be happy until you drive me out of this marriage just to prove yourself right
Ok,wait.Forget I said that
it's too late
you said it
Well,then just consider it something that husbands say to their wives

```

# DAY385

```
Marriage is a simple concept(概念)
Basically,it's a contract between two people
that binds them together for life
in the hopes that they can live happily ever after(永远) 
Sadly,some contracts...
are made to be broken
I did not mess(扰乱) with your birth control
Really? Really
Look
It's been pulled apart and put back together
It's probably a manufacturing defect
You can still see the glue marks
I'm telling you,I didn't do it
Don't insult me,Carlos
You've been whining about(抱怨) wanting a baby for months（几个月了）
Who else would it have been? (还会有谁呢？)
I don't...I don't...
Oh,no..
What?
Mama
Oh,Please
Hey,it's possible
I mean,you buy that stuff in bulk
six months at a time
right?
Yeah,So?
Before the accident
I told her how much I wanted to have a child
and she said that she would take care of(处理) it
I just thought that she would talk to you
Baby,I am so sorry

```

# DAY386

```
I've made us some cocoa
How are you feeling?
I've felt awful for two days now
I think I should see a doctor
It's probably just a touch of the flu
We'll keep an eye on it(我们会留意的)
It's this house,Zach
I feel it too
It isn't healthy for us to stay here
I told you
I'm not moving
It would be for your own good(这是为了你好)
You can't keep running around(你不能到处乱跑)
doing the kinds of things you're doing
Susan Mayer's kitchen,for example
People are gonna catch on(人们会喜欢的)
Wouldn't be great to start over?
somewhere in the country
Could meet some new friends
Maybe even meet a new girl
How about I let you sleep on it?
We'll talk about moving tomorrow
The lack of passion in her marriage
had become an unpleasant reality for Lynette
Then one day it occurred to her
The best way to fight reality...
was with a little fantasy
Of course
all the fantasy in the world won't do you any good(对你没有什么好处)
if no one shows up to enjoy it

```

# DAY387

```
Oh.That's Annabel.How ironic(多么讽刺)
How is Annabel relevant to this conversation?
Because she now comes to this house every morning
to remind you of what I'm not...
What?
She's the fantasy,Tom
The hot woman that you work with every day
with her manicured nails(修剪整齐的指甲) and her designer outfits(名牌服装)
I...I am the reality
The wife who never wears makeup
and whose clothes smell like a hamper(脏衣服篓子)
Ok,this may be the stupidest thing you've ever said
I used to be the fantasy(我曾经也让人充满幻想)
There was a time(从前) when I didn't need a maid's(女仆) outfit
because I knew I was enough for you
even wearing a smelly T-shirt
And clearly
that's no longer the case
Ok,honey,I don't know what to say
Look,if there's a way for me to fix this,I will do it
You just tell me and I will do it
No,there's nothing to fix
We've changed.That's all I'm saying(这就是我说的)
You ready?
You should go
You don't want to keep Annabel waiting

```

# DAY388

```
What do you think? Rex
I chose green so it will work
whether Gabrielle has a boy or a girl
That's great
What's the matter?You've been mopey(闷闷不乐) all day 
I'm sorry
I'm just worried about the test results
If I don't find out what's wrong with me soon
I'm gonna lose my mind(我会发疯的)
Oh,honey
You must get tired of hearing me complain
No,No,not at all
I think that we should talk about it
In fact,I think maybe we don't talk enough
I guess
Why don't we start doing things together again
as a couple?
I think that as soon as you're well enough
we should go on a vacation
Take a trip.Go somewhere fun
Remember our trip to Italy?
Yeah,Sort of(一点点)
Sort of?
You don't remember the glorious food
and the gorgeous scenery and ...
What I remember is sweating like a pig
and wishing we hadn't spent all our savings
So what would you like to go?
It doesn't matter
You decide

```

# DAY389

```
The vow is simple,really
Those who take it promise to stay together(在一起)
for better or for worse(顺境逆境)
for richer or for poorer
in sickness and in health(疾病或健康)
To honor and to cherish(互以为荣，相互珍惜)
Forsaking all others( 放弃其它所有)
Until death do us part
Yes,the vow is simple
Finding someone worthy of such a promise
is the hard part
But if we can
that's when we begin to live happily(幸福生活) ever after(从此)

```

# DAY390

```
How come I'm the only one wearing an apron?
I know it seems like we're ganging up on you
but you were moving so fast
we thought a sort of intervention was necessary
I know it's tough to hear
None of us wanted to do this
I appreciate what you guys are trying to do
I really do.Um...
I'm not gonna change my mind
In my life,I've been hurt a lot
Karl and uh...
Well, it's just taught me to be cynical and
expect the absolute worst from people
and I don't wanna live like that anyone
and when Mike asked me to move in with him
I was just happy, you know
just rediculously happy
I mean, I still am
and I wanna go with that feeling
I love him and ... I love him
So I'm gonna expect the best from Mike
and I know that he is gonna deliver that in return
Ok? - Honey
This is the worst intervention I have ever been to

```

# DAY391

```
This is fun.It's forever since we had lunch( 我们好久没有一起吃午餐了)
Well,as happy as I am to see you
I actually have an agenda
I ran into someone(遇到一个人) last week
who said you guys are looking to hire
Is that true?
Yeah
Are you thinking of coming back?
Because say the word...then I...
No,no,not me
I was actually thinking more about Tom
Oh.Tom
Yeah,he's been thinking about making a move(采取行动) for a while(有一段时间了)
He kind of feels like he's done everything he can where he is now(他现在的位置上)
Huh
Well,Tom's certainly solid(Tom 确实可靠)
He's more than solid
Tom's ideas are spectacular(壮观)
He's passionate about his work
His visual instincts(视觉直觉) are off the chart( 超乎寻常)
Is he as good as you?
He's apples,I'm oranges.
We excel in different areas
Trust me,you should give Tom a look
I don't need apples
I need someone like you
Cut throat.Ruthless
Oh.Geez,Nat
You make me sound like some kind of shark
Ah,okay
You know,actually...
If that's the kind of exec(高管) you're looking for...
You got a shark for me?
Yes.A very pretty shark

```

 # DAY392

```
What are you doing up?( 你为什么还没睡？)
I couldn't sleep so I was just...sitting here
Thinking...
About what?
You really want to know?
Bree
I'm not feeling too hot( 没心情) right so just tell me
What's up?
I was thinking that the biggest mistake of my entire
life was agreeing to marry you
Let me guess. I've done something wrong
Forcing me to share in your depraved(邪恶不堪的事情) pastime wasn't bad enough
you had to share my humiliation with your co-workers?
What?
Rex, everybody is talking about our sex life
Every sordid little detail right down to that box of perversions(变态行为) you keep in the closet(衣柜)
Bree, I never said anything to anyone
I swear to god
You're a liar
Who told you this?
Doesn't matter
It does matter because I never said anything
Well then how do people know
because we both know that I wouldn't say anything
Why would I tell people about what we do in bed?
I don't know, Rex
Maybe you were bragging(炫耀)
or maybe you just subconsciously(潜意识里) wanted to hurt me
Well, congratulations. You did it.
I am officially destroyed( 我的形象全毁了)
I didn't say anything
I don't believe you

 

```
